# Project Purpose: Personal Finance Manager

The goal is to build a web-based app that allows users to:

- Log income and expenses
- Categorize transactions
- Set monthly budgets
- View spending summaries and visualizations

The app will be interactive in the browser, with Claude used to help build and maintain the codebase.
