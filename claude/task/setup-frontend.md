# Task: Build Frontend UI

Create:

- `index.html` with a form to:
  - Add new transactions (date, amount, category, description)
  - List all existing transactions in a table
- `script.js` to:
  - Use fetch to call `/api/transactions` (GET and POST)
  - Dynamically update the table when a new transaction is added
- Style minimally using inline CSS or basic `<style>` tag.
